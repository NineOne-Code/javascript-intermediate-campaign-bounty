# Greeting

Welcome to the Learn Javascript With NineOne91 website. This simple website showcases the implementation of JavaScript classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally. You can perform addition operations, retrieve the day of the week based on an index, and try out division operations.

## How to Use

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## JavaScript Features

### JavaScript Class

We've implemented a basic JavaScript class called `Calculator` that includes two methods:
- `add(a, b)`: Adds two numbers, `a` and `b`.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Subtracts `b` from `a`.

### Switch Statement

The website includes a function `getDayOfWeek(dayIndex)` that utilizes a switch statement to convert a numeric day index into the corresponding day of the week.

### Try-Catch-Finally

The `divide(a, b)` function showcases the usage of try-catch-finally. It attempts to perform division on two numbers (`a` and `b`), catches and handles any errors (e.g., division by zero), and provides appropriate feedback.

## Example

Upon clicking the "Execute" button, you will see the following results displayed on the webpage:

- The result of addition using the `Calculator` class.
- The day of the week corresponding to the index.
- The result of division (including error handling if division by zero is attempted).

Feel free to explore and modify the JavaScript code in `index.js` to experiment with different functionalities.

## Deployment

You can deploy this website to a web hosting service or server of your choice to make it accessible to a wider audience. Simply upload the entire project directory to your hosting provider, and it should work seamlessly.
